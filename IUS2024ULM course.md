## The Sources of Super-Resolution Imaging
### The landscape of microvascular imaging

### Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM): a Super-Resolution UltraSound (SRUS) technique
  * Microbubbles are nearly fully surrounded by blood cells, flowing in vasculars
    * Red blood cells - 8 ¬µm, $10^9 \text{ml}^{-1}$;
    * Microbubbles - 3 ¬µm, $10^5 \text{ml}^{-1}$ 
  * High echogenicity is due to impedance mismatch and **resonance**
  * Performed with **near-resonant excitation** and **low acoustic pressure** to **maximizes oscillation** and  **minimize destruction** of the microbubbles
  * Microbubble oscillation is restricted in capillaries due to the confined space.
  * Nonlinear behaviour amplified by resonance ‚Üí harmonic imaging
  
### Res/volution in optics --> ULM 
  * Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2014: super-resolved fluorescence microscopy, including PALM (PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy)
  * The speaker's prior technique (MUSLI, Couture et al. Patent 2010, IUS 2011 ) was directly inspired by PALM
  * In 2013, 3D approaches were introduced

## ULM Basic Concepts and Data Acquisition

### Fundamental tradeoff
* Low MB density ‚Üí better localization
* High MB count ‚Üí better image sampling
  
### Experiment advice
* Choose a **setup** that ensures **visible and numerous** microbubbles that can be **isolated**
* Administration routes:
  * Tail vein
  * Jugular vein catheter (more control; requires surgery)
  * Intraocular (easy; limited volume)
* Bolus injection
  * ‚úÖ Easier technically (no pumps, more needle placement options, etc.)
  * ‚ùå Variable MB concentration (can degrade ULM reconstruction)
* Constant infusion
  * ‚úÖ More consistent (benifit reconstruction)
  * ‚ùå Risk of MBs floating out of suspension
* General advice 
  * Less time under anesthesia = easier injection
  * Keep animal **warm**!
  * Let tail ‚Äòhang‚Äô for a bit to improve blood pressure
  * Tape everything down. Always.
    
### Clinical ULM imaging workflow
 * Limited to **2 bolus injections** of contrast agent
 * Prefer RF data saving over IQ (skip beamforming to get more frames)
 * Select an ROI to increase amount acquired
 * A quick ‚ÄúBubbleCheck‚Äù button:
   1. Acquire \~200 frames
   2. Beamform data
   3. SVD filter
   4. Display movie
 * Aberration correction is often necessary (for brain imaging)

## ULM Data Processing

**Separation** of microbubbles from tissue

  * Nonlinear imaging (Harmonic?)
  * Motion filtering (High-pass or SVD)
  
**Localizing** sources (Deconvolution-like problem)

  * Interpolation-based
  * Gaussian fitting
  * Weighted average
  * **Radial symmetry extension**
    
**Tracking** MBs (an assignment problem) [Simpletracker and particle tracking toolbox](https://github.com/tinevez/simpletracker)
  
  * Why tracking :
    *  Filling gaps
    *  Remove duplicates
    *  Measure velocities & directions
     
**Alternative**: Track then localize (Leconte et al., 2023.)

**Motion Artifacts & Correction** methods:

  * non-rigid registration (in the kidneys: Hingot et al, 2017; Foiret et al, 2017)

## From 2D to 3D (Volumetric ULM)

* Reduces user-dependency
* VolULM is mostly isotropic (like MRI/CT)
* Accurate quantification (velocity, direction, pulsatility)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4d9edc1-41ae-4047-8490-b76dc6570d54" alt="image" width="600">

**Optimizing volULM**

* Correct transducer position (neccessary on matrix transducers)
* Better acquisition sequences (spherical or/and cylindrical)
* Beamforming modifications

## Other perspectives

* **Going faster**
  * Higher MB concentrations (Huang et al., Scientific Reports 2020)
  * Increase SNR 
  * Separate interfering microbubbles
  * Separate tracks
  * Deep learning
    
* **Solving non-rigid motion**
  * Registrater MBs to a common tissue space
  * Compensate probe, breathing, and cardiac motion

* **Through the skull**
  * Use low frequencies + aberration correction
    
* **Beyond vessels**
  * What else structure to localize?
  * Vaporizing contrast agents / Nanovesicles / Nanobubbles
    
* **New super-resolution techniques**
  * rely on red blood cells for subwavelength imaging
